# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); while it's below 1.0, minor
versions may include breaking changes.

## 0.9.2

### Added

- `connections_latest(puzzle_ids)` and `strands_latest(puzzle_ids)`: your
  saved Connections and Strands games, shaped like `wordle_latest()` (up to
  30 puzzle IDs per call; `states` only includes games you've played). Game
  data is lenient, since older games vary: every field is optional and extra
  fields are kept. `isPlayingArchive` tells games played from the archive
  apart. Requested by nyt-puzzles.
- `nytg history connections` (won or lost, mistakes, groups found) and
  `nytg history strands` (solved, other words found).
- `GET /connections/latest` and `GET /strands/latest` in the API.

## 0.9.1

### Fixed

- `nytg archive crossword-*` saved only one puzzle on dates with two (such as
  2022-12-31, where it kept the Supermega and skipped the daily). Crosswords
  are now listed from the games archive and fetched by ID; dates with two
  puzzles save each as `YYYY-MM-DD-ID`, and single-puzzle dates keep their
  `YYYY-MM-DD` names, so existing archives resume as before. Future dates
  are still fetched by date.

## 0.9.0

### Added

- `nytg-mcp`, a local MCP server for AI agents, behind the `mcp` extra
  (`pip install "nytimes-games[mcp]"`): 15 tools for puzzles (with crossword
  entries and crossings), WordleBot, the puzzle archive, your stats, today's
  games and histories, and crossword export. Answers are hidden unless
  `include_answers` is set; cookies come from `NYT_COOKIES` or your nytg
  profile and are never returned or logged; every tool is read-only except
  `export_crossword`.
- `nytgames.views`: the plain data behind nytg's commands (puzzle views with
  answers hidden, today, histories, WordleBot comparisons), shared by nytg and
  the MCP server.

## 0.8.4

### Fixed

- Saved game states from older games failed validation, failing whole
  batches in `spelling_bee_latest()` and `wordle_latest()`: Spelling Bee
  games without a `rank`, and Wordle games in a rounds-based format
  (`rounds`, `currentRoundIndex`, `puzzleComplete`, no guesses). These fields
  are now optional, the rounds-based fields are typed, and
  `WordleGameData.rounds_format` tells the formats apart. `print_date` (often
  empty on older games) and `timestamp` are optional too. Found by
  nyt-puzzles.
- `nytg today` and `nytg history` show these games as "played".

## 0.8.3

### Security

- `nytg` could print cookie values in a traceback when `NYT_COOKIES` or
  `--cookies` held a Cookie-Editor JSON export: it was parsed as a Cookie
  header string, producing an invalid header whose error message contained
  every cookie. Reported by nyt-puzzles. If you hit this, rotate your NYT
  cookies (log out and back in).

### Fixed

- `parse_cookies()` (and so `NYTGamesClient`, `NYT_COOKIES` and
  `--cookies`) accepts a JSON export or JSON object as a string.
- Cookies are checked before any request; invalid ones raise `ValueError`
  naming the cookie but never showing its value.
- `nytg` never prints raw tracebacks: unexpected errors print a one-line
  message with any cookie values redacted.

## 0.8.2

### Added

- WordleBot: `wordlebot()` returns your analysis of today's Wordle (luck and
  skill, overall and by round; needs cookies, today only, after you've opened
  WordleBot), and `wordlebot_summary(date)` returns how everyone did on any
  day since 2021-06-19, including the bot's solve paths.
- `nytg wordlebot [DATE]` compares your luck and skill with everyone's and
  shows where your skill falls among players; `--answers` shows the bot's
  paths. API routes `/wordlebot` and `/wordlebot/{date}/summary`.
- Cookies are only sent to NYT's main site, never to its static file server.

## 0.8.1

### Fixed

- `archive()` could silently drop the first day of a 31-day window when a
  date in it had two puzzles, because NYT returns at most 31 puzzles per
  request (e.g. 2022-12-01, next to 2022-12-31's daily and Supermega).
  Windows that hit the limit are now split and fetched again. Both puzzles on
  a two-puzzle date are returned, sorted by date and ID. Found by nyt-puzzles.

### Added

- `crossword_by_id(puzzle_id)` for any crossword by ID, such as the second
  puzzle on a date that has two. API route `/crosswords/id/{puzzle_id}` and
  `nytg crossword --id`.

## 0.8.0

### Added

- A live check of every game against NYT runs every morning, with a README
  badge showing the latest result. Failures open an issue automatically.
- A coverage badge.
- Puzzle structure helpers: `CrosswordPuzzle.entries()` (each entry's clue,
  full answer, squares, coordinates, crossings and referenced clues) and
  `.squares()`, `StrandsPuzzle.words()` (words with their paths) and
  `ConnectionsPuzzle.board()`. Special puzzles are kept as they are.

- `formats.fidelity(puzzle, fmt, game=None)`: what an export approximates or
  leaves out, such as shading shown as circles in .puz or italics in clues.
  `nytg crossword --save` prints these notes.
- `nytg archive` keeps a `manifest.json` per game with each file's retrieval
  time, NYT's update time, the nytimes-games version and a SHA-256 hash.
  With `--overwrite`, puzzles NYT has changed keep their previous version
  in `revisions/` and are reported as changed.
- Examples: a Letter Boxed solver, clue reuse across crosswords, and solve
  times by weekday and constructor.
- A README capability matrix: what each method returns and which fields are
  spoilers.
- Retries with exponential backoff for failed connections, timeouts, rate
  limits and NYT server errors, honoring `Retry-After`
  (`NYTGamesClient(retries=3, backoff=0.5)`). Sessions you pass in are used
  as is.
- `NYTGamesRateLimitError` (429 after retries) with `retry_after`, and a
  matching nytg message.
- `NYTGamesClient(base_url=...)`, for proxies and testing.
- `urllib3` is declared as a dependency (it comes with requests).

### Fixed

- `crossword_puzzles()` returned a validation error when NYT sends null
  results (for empty ranges and ranges that are too long); it now returns an
  empty list. Its docs recommend ranges of 90 days or less.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- `nytgames.formats`: export crosswords to Across Lite `.puz`, `.ipuz` and
  Crossword Compiler rectangular-puzzle `.xml`, with the user's saved
  progress (fill, revealed and penciled squares, and the .puz timer).
  Rebus squares, circles and shading are kept where the format allows.
  `export()`, `to_puz()`, `to_ipuz()`, `to_xml()` and `export_problems()`.
- `NYTGamesExportError` for puzzles whose gimmicks a format can't represent,
  with the reasons.
- `nytg crossword ... --save FILE [--progress]` and
  `nytg archive crossword-* --as puz|ipuz|xml`.
- API route `/crosswords/{publish_type}/{date}/download?format=puz`.

## 0.6.1

### Fixed

- Crosswords with special square labels no longer fail validation.
  `CrosswordPuzzleCell.label` is still an int for numbered squares, and a
  string for text labels such as `CW` or arrows (2000-02-13, 2007-07-01,
  2017-07-02). `CrosswordPuzzleClue.label` is optional, for special clues
  like 2016-03-24's "Around" clue.
- `nytg crossword --answers` no longer repeats letters in clues that turn a
  corner.

## 0.6.0

### Added

- `nytgames.cli.extension`: a public API for building command lines on top
  of nytg. `create_app(name=, help=, version=)` returns an independent Typer
  app with every nytg command and root option, and `run(app)` runs it with
  nytg's error messages and exit codes. `emit()`, `FormatOption`,
  `get_client()`, `resolve_cookies()`, `active_profile()`, `get_setting()`,
  `parse_date()`, `key_value_table()` and the Rich consoles help extension
  commands behave like nytg's. `create_app` and `run` are also importable
  from `nytgames.cli`.

### Changed

- Error messages name the running command, for example `mytool auth login`.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- `nytg`, a command line tool, behind the `cli` extra
  (`pip install "nytimes-games[cli]"`): puzzles for every game with answers
  hidden unless `--answers`, Spelling Bee hints, crossword grids and clues,
  `stats`, `today`, `history` (crossword, Wordle, Spelling Bee), resumable
  `archive`, gcloud-style `--format` (table, json, yaml, csv, value()),
  `auth login`, and settings and profiles in `~/.config/nytg/config.ini`.
- `archive(game, date_start, date_end)`: the puzzles published in a date
  range, with their IDs, for Wordle, Connections, Strands and the Daily, Mini
  and Midi crosswords, from NYT's games archive. Ranges longer than 31 days
  are split automatically. Also served by the API at
  `/archive/{game}/{date_start}/{date_end}`.
- `crossword_game()`, `wordle_latest()` and `spelling_bee_latest()` accept a
  list of puzzle IDs.

- Python 3.14 support. Python 3.15 is tested while it's in pre-release.

### Fixed

- `crossword_puzzles("midi")` raises `ValueError` instead of returning Daily
  puzzles, which is what NYT's list returns for Midi; use `archive()` for
  Midi puzzles. The API returns 400.

## 0.4.0

### Added

- `nytgames.api`: the REST API is now part of the package, behind the `api`
  extra (`pip install "nytimes-games[api]"`). Run it with
  `uvicorn nytgames.api:app`, customize it with `create_app()`, or mount
  `router` in your own FastAPI app with `add_exception_handlers()`. Override
  the `get_client` dependency to use your own cookies.
- `examples/api`: an example `main.py` and `Dockerfile` for running your own
  instance.
- `NYTGamesParseError` responses from the API return 502 instead of 500.

### Changed

- The package source moved to `src/nytgames` (src layout). Imports are
  unchanged.
- The API no longer pretty-prints JSON responses and no longer configures
  logging.

### Removed

- The standalone `api/` service and its deployment files.

## 0.3.2

### Fixed

- Connections picture puzzles, whose cards have `image_url` and
  `image_alt_text` instead of `content`. Added `card.text` and
  `ConnectionsPuzzle.illustrator`.

## 0.3.1

- First release on PyPI, as `nytimes-games`. Ships `py.typed`.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- `spelling_bee_puzzle(date)`: any Spelling Bee from 2018-05-06.

## 0.2.1

- Corrected the documented Letter Boxed date range.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- `letter_boxed(date)`.
- `player_stats()`: your stats for every game.
- Typed errors: `NYTGamesHTTPError`, `NYTGamesAuthenticationError`,
  `NYTGamesNotFoundError`, `NYTGamesParseError`.
- A `nytimes-games` User-Agent.

## 0.1.0

- First release as an installable library, with endpoints updated for NYT's
  current APIs.
