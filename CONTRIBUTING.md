# Contributing

Thanks for helping. NYT changes its games APIs without notice, so reports of
something that stopped working are as valuable as code.

## Reporting a bug

Open an issue with:

- the method or `nytg` command you ran (for example `connections("2026-05-06")`)
- the full error message
- your `nytimes-games` version (`python -c "import nytgames; print(nytgames.__version__)"`)

Never include your `NYT-S` cookie or other cookies in an issue.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukwam/nytimes-games.git
cd nytimes-games
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[api,cli,test]"
pytest
```

The tests mock NYT, so they run offline and don't need cookies.

Run the API locally with auto-reload:

```bash
uvicorn nytgames.api:app --reload
```

## Project layout

```

## Adding or fixing an endpoint

1. Add a method to `NYTGamesClient` in `client.py`, and a model in `models.py`.
   Models allow extra fields, so only type the fields you use or document.
2. Add a route to `api.py` that calls the client method, and a command to
   `cli/` if it's useful on the command line. Commands build JSON-compatible
   data and pass it to `output.emit()` with a table renderer, so every output
   format works. Hide answers unless `--answers` is given.
3. Add tests that mock the NYT response, and check the method against NYT
   before opening a pull request.
4. Update the tables in `README.md` and add a line to `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Pull requests

Tests run on Python 3.10 to 3.14 for every pull request, plus the next
Python release while it's in pre-release. Keep changes focused,
and explain in the description what you checked against NYT.

## Releases

Maintainers release by bumping `__version__` in `src/nytgames/__init__.py`,
updating `CHANGELOG.md`, and pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag. The publish workflow
checks the tag matches the version, runs the tests and publishes to PyPI.
